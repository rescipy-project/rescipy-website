Welcome! The reScipy project is an effort aiming to provide researchers with a set of tools and documentation to perform scientific data analysis with Python more easily and efficiently.

At present the reScipy project includes:

* the `reScipy lectures <https://rescipy-lectures.readthedocs.io>`_, a collection of tutorials on Python for scientific research.

* the `nxarray <https://nxarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package, an xarray extension for loading and saving NeXus/HDF5.

* the `spym <https://spym-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ package, a Python package for processing Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) data.

* `nxstm <https://github.com/rescipy-project/nxstm>`_, a NeXus application definition for scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).
